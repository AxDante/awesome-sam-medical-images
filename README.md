# awesome-SegmentAnything-Medical-Images

In this repo I try to collect a list of papers and works that I find interesting that utilizes the *Segment Anything Model (SAM)* to perform segmentation on medical images, utilizes SAM as part of the frameworks, or perform anaylsis or studies of SAM on medical images. Note that this SAM is a relative new model and there may be ignored papers or works that are ignored. If you find any interesting works feel free to create pull requests or [*email* me](mailto:knight16729438@gmail.com) to make the list more comprehensive.

If you find some ignored papers, **feel free to [*create pull requests*](https://github.com/cmhungsteve/Awesome-Transformer-Attention/blob/main/How-to-PR.md), [*open issues*](https://github.com/cmhungsteve/Awesome-Transformer-Attention/issues/new), or [*email* me](mailto:vitec6@gmail.com)**. <br> 
Contributions in any form to make this list more comprehensive are welcome.
